# LookAnimation

I saw this [really cool animation](https://dribbble.com/shots/2374234-Look-flow) by __Aleksandr Larionov__ and I wanted to see if I could implement it.
Actually a basic implementation of this animation is quite simple, the hardest part is to properly break it in smaller animations, find the right place to init the view and gather all the code in a dedicated class.

The gif quality is bad but the result is pretty good in my opinion, I didn't have pictures for every product so I used colors instead. Try it out!
